### Getting started

In the next page you will receive instructions on how to obtain your Android phone apps timestamps data, which is labeled as "*My Activity*" in the Google Takeout platform. Once you have received your file, you will fill out a short questionnaire in which you will be able to upload it. If you choose to, you will be able to remove all apps names from the downloaded data before uploading the file.

It takes less than 15 minutes for most people to "order" this file from Google. I would suggest using a laptop or a desktop computer for comfort, although it is just as easy on a phone. Don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you face any issues whatsoever!

### **The DigitalRhythmsProject** by the *de la Iglesia lab* at the University of Washington

### Hello,

The <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/delaiglesialab/wordpress/" target="_blank">*de la Iglesia lab*</a> at the UW Department of Biology is looking to recruit potential volunteers for a research project. We are sure you are have all experienced changes in your biological rhythms during the stay-at-home order periods, and our lab is actively investigating this.

In addition to our ongoing study monitoring sleep-wake cycles during the pandemic, we are also interested in how schedules and working habits may be changing as a result of the stay-at-home order. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our ability to go to work and most of us have been working mostly remotely for the last year. This has, to some extent, removed some of the social pressures to maintain a fixed schedule and we believe this may affect the timing of our sleep-wake cycle.

**We are looking for volunteers older than 18 years old who are Android phone users that are or have been mostly teleworking through some time in the last year to fill out a survey and provide us with phone usage metadata that can help us better understand how schedules and working habits have changed during the pandemic.**

To complete the study, you would need to:

**1)**	Complete a consent procedure, which will have to be done online, for obvious reasons.

**2)**	Fill out a one-time survey answering questions about your daily routine and working habits.

**3)**	Provide us with the timestamps of your phone app usage for the last 2-12 months (depending on how long you have been using an Android phone). We have established a procedure for participants to download their data and share the timestamps associated with your phone – we will **NOT** ask you to provide us with ANY of the sensitive contents of your apps usage other than the time and date on which you used them, and we will give you an opportunity to remove any sensitive information from your contributed data.

We expect participating in our study should require one hour of your time at very most if completed in a single session from start to finish, BUT the most part of this time will be spent waiting for the timestamps file to be ready for download on Google’s servers. Your actual participation should not demand more than 20-30 minutes. Moreover, you do not need to complete all steps in a single session.

Unfortunately, we are not able to compensate for this study and participation would be on a volunteer basis.

There is the potential for breach of confidentiality. All the data will be separated from your identifiers and linked with a code as soon as we download it, so nobody should be able to know whose data we are looking at, except for the person downloading the data and de-identifying it, which will be a postdoc in my lab, or myself. We also understand privacy concerns associated with downloading and sharing your email data – we have protocols in place to protect your privacy and are happy to provide more information on this if you are interested in participating.

We think this is an important project because it could provide relevant information about how people deal
with such difficult situations, and how different household compositions (an initial questionnaire will
provide this information) can affect stay-at-home activity, working habits and sleep patterns.

If you have questions later about the research, or if you have been harmed by participating in this study, you can contact one of the researchers listed on this consent form.  If you have questions about your rights as a research subject, you can call the Human Subjects Division at (206) 543-0098 or call collect at (206) 221-5940.

Please feel free to distribute widely. Those who are interested in participating please contact the research

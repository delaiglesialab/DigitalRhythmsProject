# Step 2 of 2: Consent and Questionnaires

Please ensure you've obtained a data file, viewed it and are comfortable with sharing it before moving forward. 

1.  First, fill out the consent form <a href="https://redcap.iths.org/surveys/?s=34X3HD7YYL" target="_blank">here.</a>

2.  Next, submit your details and receive your *unique* 5 character code <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIIiCoDeyHSJua0dggl3DbIPoXbTsXZiq2M7ozJJpS9qKqWA/viewform" target="_blank">here</a>
    
    ***Please use the links from this page and not the one offered when you submit this form***

    Make sure you rename each file that you will be submitting with the code! This step is independent to ensure that your name, contact and code are available together only for the consent document, and not even on our own systems.

3. Finally, once you've **re-named** the file, upload that and fill out the questionnaire <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemCWlRHmJQAsM_O9g9rORyiRFyMrVUIczpaGzGJbNuIB4jtQ/viewform" target="_blank">here</a>

## (Extra) Visualize it yourself!

As a little thank you for your efforts, we provide a colab notebook that allows you to visualize your own data in just a few clicks, and even helps you learn some interesting things about yourself! (Click on the icon below to open it)

Note: The notebook is still in development and built to be a tutorial for students. It will be updated with a dedicated notebook for visualization soon!

# The DigitalRhythms Project

Our current study focuses on the effect COVID-19 had on our work rhythms. We believe that the stay-at-home orders forced people into a very peculiar situation, drawn away from the social conventions of 9-to-5 worklife. We believe that the digital footprints we leave when engaging with technology everyday may provide a valuable proxy to study our daily habits and the changes experimented during such particular events.

**Please consider taking some time to help us by following the instructions below and sharing your data for our research project!**

As a little *thank you* for your time and effort, we will offer you an online tool to help you visualize your own data in nice looking and informative graphs, which you will find linked at the end of this process.

## How to help with your data


At this time in the project we are interested in gathering Android phone app usage timestamps. Almost anyone using an Android phone can contribute; we currently don't have a method for iPhones at this time, but please consider sharing this website with any Android users among your friends and family.

Don't hesitate to share your data even if you feel you don't use your phone enough. You'd be surprised at how helpful the data may be for us!

# About Us and Contact details

The <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/delaiglesialab/wordpress/">de la Iglesia lab </a> at the Department of Biology in the University of Washington is focused on studying the biological rhythms of sleep and behavior in animal models and humans. One of our main interests is the study of human sleep in real life situations, specially under what you may call "unconventional situations": during a lockdown in the middle of pandemic, in communities living in isolation with no access to electricity, in persons experiencing homelessness, and others.

Feel free to contact us regarding any concerns or suggestions.
